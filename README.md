A traveler would like to see the weather outlook for multiple cities for planning a trip. To do so, weather dashboard allows the traveler (user) to search for a city by typing in its name and will then be presented with current and future conditions for that city.  The entered city is added to the search history.

When a user views the current weather conditions for that city the date, an icon representation of weather conditions as well as information regarding the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed are displayed.  Future weather conditions for that city will also be displayed with a 5-day forecast visually indicating the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.  A user can click on any city in the search history to see the current and future conditions for that city.
